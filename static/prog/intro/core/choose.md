Thanks for finishing the core section. The rest of the course still
needs a lot of work, but feel free to poke around if you like.

You've finished all the core concepts. Instead of reading the
following pages one after the other, look at the **programs** section
at the bottom of the sidebar. The programs there are sorted by
difficulty, so you may want to work your way roughly from top to
bottom. The page will guide you through writing the program, but it
will not tell you how to do each individual step. Each page will
include links like these:

{{< req "int/file-input"
        "int/text-parsing" >}}

The links contain the tools you must understand to write the program. After
reading the links, you must figure out how to apply what you've learned to the
program you're trying to write.

At the end of each page, I'll include a link to the completed program that I
wrote. Compare your program to mine so you can see what we did differently.
Resist the temptation to look at my solution before you've finished your own;
that could deprive you of an important learning experience.

Good luck!
