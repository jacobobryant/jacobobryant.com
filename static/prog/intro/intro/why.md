Many people would like to learn programming but don't know where to
start. Some people take an introductory computer science course in
college only to be scarred by the experience. I was fortunate
to be introduced to programming at a young age by my dad, and I've
been in love with it ever since. I created this course to help
absolute beginners gain a solid foundation in coding so they can
continue learning on their own if they so desire.

But let's take a step back. Why would you want to learn programming in
the first place? Here are a few possible reasons:

 - **It could turn into a lifelong passion.** Regardless of what you
   end up doing with it, programming is a
   [highly creative](http://www.paulgraham.com/hp.html) and
   satisfying discipline like music or painting.
 - **It can make a great career.** If you find out that you enjoy
   programming, you can do what you love and still be able to support
   a family.
 - **It's a great supplement to other careers.** It's handy to know
   how to throw together a simple website when you need one. Simple
   programs can help a lot with analyzing data from experimental
   research. Many boring, repetitive tasks can be automated with
   programming; learning how to program will help you see
   the opportunities to use it in your everyday life.
 - **It teaches you to think in a new way.** Programming makes you
   think logically, kind of like math. If you don't like math, you may
   find that programming is a fresh, enjoyable way to learn what math
   was supposed to teach you.

In short, programming has something to offer for everyone. I can't
think of anyone who wouldn't benefit from exposure to programming,
even if they decide not to pursue it.

The next page will give you a light introduction to your first
programming language.

This course is still in early development. Many pieces are
missing. If you are evaluating this course for me, complete the
introduction and core sections. I especially need to know about what
problems you run into, along with any other feedback you have. Send an
email to foo@jacobobryant.com. Thanks!
