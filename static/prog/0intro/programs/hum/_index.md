This is a simple game my dad would play with my siblings and me when we were little.
He would hold up a certain number of fingers behind his back, and we would guess
how many. If we guessed wrong, he would change the number of fingers and we would keep guessing until
we got it right. An example run of the program goes like this:

	$ python hum.py
	humbledee bumbledee cow's pluck,
	how many fingers do I hold up? 4
	4 you said, but 3 it was! So,
	humbledee bumbledee cow's pluck,
	how many fingers do I hold up? 2
	2 you said, but 4 it was! So,
	humbledee bumbledee cow's pluck,
	how many fingers do I hold up? 4
	4 you said, and 4 it was!
