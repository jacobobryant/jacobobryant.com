Definition: the chemical process by which pizza is converted to
software.

Many people would like to learn programming but don't know where to
start. Some people find a starting point (e.g. an introductory
computer science course in college) but have trouble learning the
material. My goal is to help solve both problems.

The next page has a roadmap which describes different areas of
software development that you can learn about. You can think of the
different areas like courses that you might take in a college computer
science program. For each course, I will provide advice and links to
resources (e.g. online tutorials) that will help you learn it. As time
permits, I'll add my own tutorials to this website.

By learning the material described in the roadmap, you will gradually
reach the point where you don't need guidance from people like me
anymore; you'll be able to progress by coming up with questions and
doing the research to answer them on your own. This is how experienced
coders learn.

But let's take a step back. Why would you want to learn programming in
the first place? Here are a few possible reasons:

 - **It could turn into a lifelong passion.** Regardless of what you
   end up doing with it, programming is a
   [highly creative](http://www.paulgraham.com/hp.html) and
   satisfying discipline like music or painting.
 - **It can make a great career.** If you find out that you enjoy
   programming, you can do what you love and still be able to support
   a family.
 - **It's a great supplement to other careers.** It's handy to know
   how to throw together a website when you need one. Simple programs
   can help a lot with analyzing data from experimental research. Many
   boring, repetitive tasks can be automated with programming;
   learning how to program will help you see the opportunities to use
   it in your everyday life.
 - **It teaches you to think in a new way.** Programming makes you
   think logically, kind of like math. If you don't like math, you may
   find that programming is a fresh, enjoyable way to learn what math
   was supposed to teach you.

In short, programming has something to offer for everyone. I can't
think of anyone who wouldn't benefit from exposure to programming,
even if they decide not to pursue it.

Now it's time to see [the roadmap](roadmap).
