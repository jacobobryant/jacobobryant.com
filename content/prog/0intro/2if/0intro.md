In this section I'll teach you how to write programs that make
decisions. Just look at this:

<pre>
>>> %Run five.py
Enter a number greater than five: <b>6</b>

>>> %Run five.py
Enter a number greater than five: <b>4</b>
moron
</pre>

It does different things depending on what user input it gets.
Fascinating.
