Previously we showed things like:

	>>> foo = 666
	>>> print(foo)
	666

The shell (the bottom box in Thonny) has a shortcut: if you leave out
`print`, the shell will show you the value of whatever you typed:

	>>> foo = 666
	>>> foo
	666
	>>> bar = "hello there"
	>>> bar
	'hello there'

I'll write it this way in future examples to save typing. But when you
write programs in the top box in Thonny (like `basic_io.py`), remember
to use `print`.
