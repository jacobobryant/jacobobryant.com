<!--
The next few sections will each teach you a different thing that you
need to understand in order to make the high-low game shown in the
course [overview](../../). After completing the sections, I'll walk
you through the thought process that an experienced programmer would
use to write the game. This first section will teach you about **IO**.
-->

**IO** is short for input/output. Input is when the user talks to the
program; output is when the program talks to the user. This section
will teach you how to do some basic io so you can make a program that
does this:

<pre>
>>> %Run basic_io.py
What is your name? <b>kevin</b>
Go away kevin
</pre>
