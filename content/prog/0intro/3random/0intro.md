Remember the high-low program from the [course overview](..)?
Do you see how `if` could be helpful in writing that program?

Imagine you're writing that program and you have two variables which
contain the computer's number and your guess. You can use `if` to
figure out if the guess is correct or not:

    >>> if computer_number == your_guess:
            print("you got it right")
        else:
            print("wrong!")

However, there are a few more things you need to learn before you can write
high-low. For example, how do you make the computer choose a random
number? That's what we'll learn about in this section.
