**How to learn Python**


More importantly, you should be able to run the Python command. So type
"python". You should see something kind of like this:

```
Python 3.5.2 (default, Jun 28 2016, 08:46:01) 
[GCC 6.1.1 20160602] on linux
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>>
```

The ">>>" is called a prompt. It means you should type something. Try typing
"print('hello world')". It will look like this:

```
>>> print('hello world')
hello world
>>>
```

Congratulations, you ran your first Python command. I don't count that as doing
the "hello world" thing, though, because you have to save your program in a
file. Most programmers like to do that because it's kind of a pain to re-type a
program every time you want to run it. There's a technical term for doing
something like that: stupid. That's why it doesn't count.

What you need is a text editor. Like programming languages, there are many text
editors. Here is a classification that you may use as a reference:

COOL: vim

NOT COOL: everything else

THE WORST: notepad

Yes, it's true. Windows comes with exactly one text editor preinstalled, and it
happens to be the worst one. It's good enough for hello world, but that's it.
I'll give you more instructions later. For now, just use whatever text editor
comes with your operating system. If you're on Linux, that might be "gedit".
gedit is decent.














Each page in this course teaches one small part of Python. These parts
will be the building blocks of your programs. Make sure you have a
an understanding of each page before you move on. Later pages build on
earlier ones. Every few pages, I'll give you a description of a
program for you to write. These programs will require you to use the
things you've learned in the previous pages. You may need to go back
and review pages you've already covered, but once 


Python (like all other langauges) has many different parts. 
These
parts are like tools. Y

The more you learn, the more tools you'll have
in your toolbelt. 




With that out of the way, it's time to begin your journey of enlightenment. As
you learn to code, there are a few decisions you will need to make. To simplify
your life, I will make them for you. I also will, however, grace you with an
explanation of these decisions so that you can feel more involved and have
self-esteem.

**Decision number 1:** Which programming language should I start with?

There are many languages, all of which may be partitioned into two groups: cool
languages and not cool languages. Here are a few of those languages:

COOL: Python, C, LISP

NOT COOL: Java, C++, Visual Basic

If you take any computer science classes or get a job, you may have the
misfortune of having to use some sucky languages. But for now, you will start
with Python. Python is a powerful language. It's been the main language I've
used in both the jobs I've had so far. It also is very pleasant to use. It is
all around a great choice to start out with.

Side note: If you stick with programming, you would benefit from learning C. C
is a less-powerful language than Python. Programming in it is like doing
multi-digit multiplication by hand. Python is like using a calculator. You
should know how your tools work. But you don't need to worry about that right
now.

**Decision number 2:** How do I do everything else?

The best way to learn programming is by doing it. Books and classes can be good
for deepening your horizons, but you can get by at first with shallow horizons.
Instead, you should figure out something you want to make, and then you should
make it.
