You can also type Python commands directly into the lower box (the
"shell"):

![cheese](cheese.png)

This is useful for trying out commands as you learn them. For the sake
of me not having to take tons of screenshots, I'll demonstrate
commands like this:

```
>>> print("I like cheese")
I like cheese
```

Type `print("Gouda's my favorite")` into the lower box and then hit
Enter. Make sure to type in the command exactly (you can copy and
paste if you want).
