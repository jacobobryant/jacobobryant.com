You can use Python like a calculator:

	>>> 2 + 2 - 1
	3
	>>> 7 * 3
	21
	>>> 15 / 2
	7.5

You can do exponentiation with the `**` operator:

	>>> 2 ** 3
	8

Be careful, because with great power comes great responsibility:

	>>> 666 / 0
	Traceback (most recent call last):
	  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
	ZeroDivisionError: division by zero

You can store these calculations in variables:

	>>> how_many_times = 70 * 7
	>>> how_many_times
	490
