There are many commands available to you in Python. These commands are called "functions." The `print` function displays a message to the user (it "prints" the message to your screen). You can use it like this:

	>>> print("hello world")
	hello world

Using a function like this is called "calling" a function. You call a function by adding parentheses at the end. You can give information to the function by putting things inside the parentheses. Each piece of information we give to the function is called an "argument." Above, we passed only one argument (a line of text) to `print`. We can pass multiple arguments to a function by separating the arguments with commas, like this:

	>>> print("one", 2, "three")
	one 2 three
