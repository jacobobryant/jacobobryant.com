Many people would like to learn programming but don't know where to
start. My aim for this course, in addition to teaching you a
programming language, is to be a roadmap for you in the world of
coding. After finishing this course, you should have a solid
foundation that will make it easier for you to continue learning on
your own.

The next page will give you a light introduction to programming.
