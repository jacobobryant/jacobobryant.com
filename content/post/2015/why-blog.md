I like writing about the thoughts in my head because it helps me to have more
thoughts.

(That's why I'm writing this particular post, in fact. I 
want to make sure I
understand concretely what I'm trying to get out of this blog)

I often have rather in-depth monologues going on inside my head, but they
usually stay there unless they make it into my journal. Blogging will help me
to get a tighter grip on all the ideas that come into my head, and ideas are
valuable things. <a href="http://paulgraham.com">Paul Graham</a> has written <a
href="http://paulgraham.com/essay.html">an entire essay</a> about this concept.
In it he explains: <blockquote>Expressing ideas helps to form them.
Indeed, helps is far too weak a word. Most of what ends up in my essays I only
thought of when I sat down to write them. That's why I write them.</blockquote>
I highly recommend reading that essay. I just reread it, and I already have a
stronger desire to think more.

Actually, I recommend reading any essay written by Paul Graham. His
wisdom-filled writings have been a powerful inspiration to me, and they often
change the way I think about the world. He is a great thinker, and it's
probably partly because he writes so much. I would like to be like that.

So yes, that's the impetus behind this website. I do have a few ulterior
motives, though. I have a few plans for monetizing it in case I gain enough
popularity. My favorite would be to write reviews for gadgets and things and
then have companies send me free stuff in exchange. Short of that, I guess I
can always resort to adding a "donate to my <del>World of Warcraft
account</del> college fund" button. Either way, the current business model is
simple: <ol> <li>Write interesting things</li> <li>???</li> <li>Profit!</li>
</ol> 
I find that I like writing my ideas here a lot more than just writing
them in my journal. It's comforting to have the possibility of someone
reading the fruits of my labors, and that's not very likely with only
a journal (except for the case of hooligans raiding my house).

So here's to many thought-provoking blog posts in the years to come. Ho ho ho.
