I believe that privacy is important. It needs to be
protected more than it currently is. My opinion on this has come from
a lot of reading and thinking. I would like to advocate for privacy in
my own small way by helping others to see why I hold these opinions,
whether or not they decide to believe similarly.

Other privacy advocates often talk about the ideological value of privacy. I
mostly agree with what they have to say, but I think there's a better
way to show the need for privacy. I am in the process of listing
relevant privacy questions on this page along with related, concrete
facts. I haven't listed many yet, but eventually these facts will
demonstrate why we should care more about privacy.
